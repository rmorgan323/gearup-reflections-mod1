I liked this session.  It helped me to not fear the things that I don't know.  I still struggle with the idea that I can't know everything I'll need to know, but a growth mindset means you don't have to worry about that.  Instead, it makes the daily challenge of learning enjoyable.

One other tidbit: the Turing program wasn't designed such that a student would make perfect scores on every project.  While that is very different from any other schooling I've been involved with in the past, I see this as a good thing that will keep me focused on growth more than grades.

I have an added response as I went back through my notes today, at the end of Mod 1.  I noted on the day we talked about growth mindset that, reading through the number guesser project had put me at least in part into a fixed mindset.  There were a bunch of things I didn't understand how to do when I first read through the project requirements.  Now, only 4 weeks later, I bet I could rewrite that entire project in an hour or two, and it would be better.  So there has been significant progress which is nice to see.
