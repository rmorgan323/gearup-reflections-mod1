I think this film is designed to bring about strong emotions, and indeed it does.  From my experience, the job of being a developer has been talked down and "nerdified" in main stream culture to the point where people who desire to be cool would never consider it.  I think this misconception has had a lot to do with why a lot people have sadly avoided an interesting and profitable industry.

I wondered when I heard the terrible stories about women in the industry being treated so poorly if this was a rampant problem or if these were isolated circumstances.  I would have liked a lot more context to better understand what happened--like the point of view of others near the situation.  Or to hear from women who are doing great as developers and are valued in their workplaces.  Also, if I'm not wrong, all of the events in the film took place in and around San Francisco.  So I wonder what the situation is like in Denver and other places.  I agree that diversity is greatly desirable in the industry, but I'm not sure this film is going to convince women to become developers.

And finally, I dislike the terms tolerance and inclusion.  It isn't because they aren't good--they are fine.  It's because tolerance and inclusion don't go nearly far enough.  There is a lot of hate in this world, that can not be defeated by things so minimal.  Instead, I'd recommend choosing to love people first.  If you choose to love them as people and as fellow travelers through this world, then you'll see them as brothers and sisters, not just random people in random places.  Tolerance and inclusion are the very least that you can do for someone--only a short step above hate.  Love goes a lot further, is more challenging, but is powerful enough to deal with the hate that exists in this world.  I've got a whole lot more to say about this, but this isn't the forum.
