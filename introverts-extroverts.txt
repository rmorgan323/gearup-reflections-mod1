I wasn't surprised by a lot here but picked up a few things.  I'm pretty heavily introverted and as a result have a difficult time understanding why extroverts are the way they are.  As well, it doesn't seem like extroverts fully understand introverts.  What we talked about today was that it isn't as important to understand why someone doesn't think similarly, but it is important to give someone the space and freedom to be the best version of themselves they can be.  A more extroverted person may need to talk through a problem where a more introverted person may choose to think through that problem instead.  Neither approach is wrong.  Also, no one is 100% introverted or extroverted.  We're all somewhere in between and I'd even bet that can change a little bit from day to day depending on how we're feeling.  So, when dealing with others, it's important to treat others right, no matter where they are at on any given day.
