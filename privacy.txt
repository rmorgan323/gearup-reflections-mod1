I took two things away from our discussion.  First, is the bad part.  The amount of information that exists in the wild about each of us is a bit scary.  Nearly all of us in the class wished this wasn't the case, though there weren't any solutions brought forward.  It would take a political movement/new laws to attempt to limit the amount of information that can be gathered about each of us.  In the meantime, we should all be careful what we do and where we go online.

But secondly, from a business standpoint, there is almost limitless opportunity to better understand your target market.  When this information is used wisely and appropriately, it can really benefit a business.  I don't believe you have to invade people's privacy to gain valuable insights into customer behavior that can be used to better serve them--and as a result, improve your bottom line.
