I enjoyed this session.  I've learned most things in my life by figuring them out on my own, with the help of resources like youtube or lynda.com, or before those existed, books.  I can see now that there is a better way.  Learning from a master, being willing to ask lots of questions, even if it means giving up some of my percieved independence, will help me learn faster and better.

As I look back through my notes from that session, here at the end of Mod 1, I'll add one more thing.  A big part of the model at Turing is to take what you've learned and teach it to others, through formal pairing, or simply by looking for someone with "that look" in their eyes who needs help.  In the last few weeks, I've focused a lot on helping others figure out the stuff that I've got down.  That hasn't helped only them.  I've solidified many topics by helping others understand them.  So both sides of a pairing got a lot out their time--which is pretty cool.
